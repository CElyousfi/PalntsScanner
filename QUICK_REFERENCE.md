## 🎯 The Core Philosophy (Lorikeet Applied)

### **10 Operating Principles**
1. **Farmers First, Always** - Charge only when crops are saved
2. **Resolution Over Deflection** - Success = crop saved, not diagnosis given
3. **High Agency, High Value** - AI takes actions, not just recommends
4. **Specialization = Defensibility** - Export tomatoes only (regulated)
5. **Radical Transparency** - Show reasoning, admit uncertainty
6. **Front-Page Test** - Every decision must be publicly defensible
7. **Excellence Without Toxicity** - High standards, humble execution
8. **Backwards Reasoning** - Start with ideal outcome, work backwards
9. **Charge for Outcomes** - 2.5% of value saved, not per API call
10. **Measure What Matters** - Resolution rate, not vanity metrics

---

## 📊 Key Metrics (The Only Numbers That Matter)

### **Primary Metric**
**Resolution Rate**: % of diagnoses where crop was actually saved
- **Current**: Unknown (not measured)
- **Target**: 80% by Week 12
- **How**: Follow-up photos + farmer confirmation

### **Secondary Metrics**
1. **Time to Action**: Upload → treatment purchased
   - Target: <2 hours
2. **Economic Impact**: € saved per € spent
   - Target: 15:1 ROI
3. **User Satisfaction**: Net Promoter Score
   - Target: NPS >70

### **Anti-Metrics** (Don't Optimize)
- ❌ Number of diagnoses (vanity)
- ❌ Time on site (want farmers farming, not using app)
- ❌ Feature count (more ≠ better)

---

## 🎯 Specialization Strategy

### **Chosen Niche**
**Export-grade tomatoes in Morocco (EU compliance required)**

**Why?**
- High stakes: €5k-€20k/hectare at risk
- Regulatory complexity: EU pesticide limits, organic certification
- Willingness to pay: 10x higher than subsistence farming
- Defensibility: Generic AI can't handle compliance

**Expansion Path**
1. **Phase 1**: Tomatoes, Morocco
2. **Phase 2**: Peppers, cucumbers (adjacent crops)
3. **Phase 3**: Tunisia, Spain (adjacent regions)
4. **Phase 4**: Global standard for regulated crops

---

## 💰 Business Model

### **Pricing**
1. **Free**: Diagnosis + recommendations (prove value)
2. **Success Fee**: 2-5% of crop value saved (primary revenue)
3. **Subscription**: €200/month unlimited (large farms)
4. **Enterprise**: Custom (cooperatives, exporters)

### **Revenue Streams**
1. Success fees (2.5% of value saved)
2. Supplier commissions (5-10% referral fee)
3. Data licensing (anonymized disease patterns)
4. Certification services (fast-track organic)
5. Insurance partnerships (risk assessment data)

### **Example Economics**
- Farmer saves €5,000 crop
- We charge €125 (2.5%)
- Supplier pays €15 commission
- **Total revenue**: €140 per case
- **Margin**: ~100% (pure software)

## 🚨 Critical Warnings

### **Don't Do This**
- ❌ Add features without measuring outcomes
- ❌ Stay generic ("works for any crop")
- ❌ Charge for diagnostics (charge for outcomes)
- ❌ Use mock data (get real suppliers)
- ❌ Skip metrics (measure resolution rate obsessively)

### **Do This Instead**
- ✅ Measure resolution rate weekly
- ✅ Specialize ruthlessly (one crop, one region)
- ✅ Charge for value created (crop saved)
- ✅ Integrate deeply (suppliers, weather, compliance)
- ✅ Build safety-first (compliance, transparency)

---

## 🦜 The Lorikeet Test

**Every week, ask these 5 questions:**

1. **Did we increase resolution rate?**
   - If yes → Great, keep going
   - If no → Why not? Fix it.

2. **Did we reduce time-to-action?**
   - Target: <2 hours upload → treatment purchased

3. **Did we create value for farmers?**
   - Measure: € saved, crops recovered

4. **Did we charge for outcomes?**
   - Not API calls, not subscriptions (yet)

5. **Did we deepen our specialization?**
   - EU compliance, supplier network, certification

**If 4+ are "Yes" → On track**
**If <4 are "Yes" → Refocus on fundamentals**

---

## 💡 Quick Decision Framework

**When evaluating any decision (feature, hire, partnership):**

```
1. Farmers First: Does this help save crops? (Y/N)
2. Resolution: Does this increase resolution rate? (Y/N)
3. Agency: Does this enable action, not just advice? (Y/N)
4. Specialization: Does this deepen our moat? (Y/N)
5. Transparency: Can we explain and defend this? (Y/N)
6. Front-Page Test: Would we be proud if public? (Y/N)
7. Excellence: Does this meet our quality standard? (Y/N)
8. Backwards: Did we start with ideal outcome? (Y/N)
9. Outcomes: Are we charging for value created? (Y/N)
10. Metrics: Will this move core metrics? (Y/N)

If 8+ "Yes" → Proceed
If 5-7 "Yes" → Reconsider
If <5 "Yes" → Reject
```

## 🦜 Remember

**Lorikeet beat Silicon Valley with:**
- User-obsession (not tech-obsession)
- Outcomes (not features)
- Specialization (not generalization)
- Execution (not funding)
- Explicit culture (not implicit chaos)

**We can do the same in agriculture.**

**From demo to killer product.**
**From Morocco to the world.**

🌿 **Let's go. Week 1 starts now.**
