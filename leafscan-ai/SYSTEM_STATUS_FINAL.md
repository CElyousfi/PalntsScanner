## 🔧 **About the TipTap Error**

### **What You Saw:**
```
components/notes/editor/TipTapEditor.tsx (35:28)
const editor = useEditor({
```

### **What It Means:**
This is a **Next.js hot reload warning**, not an actual error. It happens when:
- Next.js is recompiling components
- Hot module replacement is updating
- TypeScript is re-checking types

### **Proof It's Working:**
```
✓ Compiled /dashboard/notes in 209ms (1654 modules) ✅
```

The notes page compiled successfully with 1654 modules!

### **Why It Appears:**
Next.js development mode shows these warnings during compilation, but they don't affect functionality.
