❌ Copy-paste suggestions that need editing  
❌ Disconnected from your actual farm data  
❌ Hype without substance  

### **Real Farm Intelligence**
✅ **Context-Aware**: Knows your crops, location, growth stage  
✅ **Data-Driven**: Uses actual farm metrics and history  
✅ **Actionable**: Generates specific, useful recommendations  
✅ **Integrated**: Connects all farm systems together  
✅ **Predictive**: Forecasts issues before they happen
