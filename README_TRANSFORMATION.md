## 🎯 The Transformation

### **From Demo to Killer Product**

**Current State (Demo):**
- ❌ Mock supplier data
- ❌ No outcome tracking
- ❌ No metrics (resolution rate unknown)
- ❌ Generic (any crop, any location)
- ❌ Free tier only (no revenue)
- ❌ Passive AI (recommendations only)

**Target State (Week 12):**
- ✅ Real suppliers (10+ verified, API-integrated)
- ✅ Outcome tracking (photo verification, farmer confirmation)
- ✅ Metrics dashboard (80% resolution rate)
- ✅ Specialized (export tomatoes, Morocco, EU compliance)
- ✅ Value-based pricing (€10k MRR)
- ✅ High-agency AI (reserves treatment, schedules applications)

## 🦜 The Lorikeet Philosophy

### **10 Operating Principles**

1. **Farmers First, Always** - Charge only when crops saved
2. **Resolution Over Deflection** - Success = crop saved, not diagnosis
3. **High Agency, High Value** - AI takes actions, not just recommends
4. **Specialization = Defensibility** - Export tomatoes (regulated)
5. **Radical Transparency** - Show reasoning, admit uncertainty
6. **Front-Page Test** - Every decision publicly defensible
7. **Excellence Without Toxicity** - High standards, humble execution
8. **Backwards Reasoning** - Start with ideal outcome
9. **Charge for Outcomes** - 2.5% of value saved
10. **Measure What Matters** - Resolution rate, not vanity metrics

---

## 📊 Key Metrics

### **North Star Metric**
**Resolution Rate: 80% by Week 12**
- % of diagnoses where crop was actually saved
- Current: Unknown → Target: 80%

### **Primary Metrics**
1. **Time to Action**: <2 hours (upload → treatment purchased)
2. **Economic Impact**: 15:1 ROI (€15 saved per €1 spent)
3. **User Satisfaction**: NPS >70 (would recommend)

### **Business Metrics**
1. **MRR**: €10k by Week 12
2. **Active Farmers**: 500
3. **Churn Rate**: <5%

---

## 🎯 Specialization: Export Tomatoes, Morocco

### **Why This Niche?**

**1. High Stakes**
- Crop value: €5,000-€20,000 per hectare
- Willingness to pay: €100-€500 per season

**2. Regulatory Complexity**
- EU pesticide limits (500+ approved, 1,000+ banned)
- Organic certification (Ecocert, USDA)
- Traceability requirements

**3. Defensibility**
- Generic AI can't handle compliance
- Takes years to build supplier network
- Proprietary outcome data

**4. Network Effects**
- 50,000 hectares in Casablanca
- Tight-knit community (word-of-mouth)
- Concentrated suppliers

---

## 💰 Value-Based Pricing

### **Success Fee Model**
```
Charge = Crop Value Saved × 2.5%

Example:
- Crop value: €10,000
- Without treatment: 40% loss = €4,000
- With treatment: 5% loss = €500
- Value saved: €3,500
- Our fee: €87.50 (2.5%)
- Farmer ROI: 40:1
```

### **4 Pricing Tiers**
1. **Free**: Diagnosis + recommendations (prove value)
2. **Success Fee**: 2.5% of value saved (primary revenue)
3. **Subscription**: €200/month unlimited (large farms)
4. **Enterprise**: Custom pricing (cooperatives)

### **Additional Revenue**
- Supplier commissions (10%)
- Data licensing (€50k-€500k/year)
- Certification services (€500-€5,000)
- Insurance partnerships (revenue share)

## 🚨 Critical Warnings

### **Don't Do This**
- ❌ Add features without measuring outcomes
- ❌ Stay generic ("works for any crop")
- ❌ Charge for diagnostics (charge for outcomes)
- ❌ Use mock data (get real suppliers)
- ❌ Skip metrics (measure resolution rate obsessively)

### **Do This Instead**
- ✅ Measure resolution rate weekly
- ✅ Specialize ruthlessly (one crop, one region)
- ✅ Charge for value created (crop saved)
- ✅ Integrate deeply (suppliers, weather, compliance)
- ✅ Build safety-first (compliance, transparency)

## 🦜 The Lorikeet Standard

**Lorikeet beat Silicon Valley with:**
- User-obsession (not tech-obsession)
- Outcomes (not features)
- Specialization (not generalization)
- Execution (not funding)
- Explicit culture (not implicit chaos)

**We're doing the same in agriculture:**
- Farmer-obsession (crops saved, not diagnoses)
- Outcomes (resolution rate, not accuracy)
- Specialization (export tomatoes, not any crop)
- Execution (12-week roadmap)
- Explicit culture (10 operating principles)

---

- [ ] I understand Lorikeet's philosophy
- [ ] I commit to 80% resolution rate
- [ ] I commit to value-based pricing
