## 🦜 The Lorikeet Standard Applied

### **What Lorikeet Did:**
- Specialized in regulated industries (fintech, healthcare)
- Built deep expertise (compliance, security)
- Charged for outcomes (resolutions, not API calls)
- High-agency AI (takes actions, not just recommends)
- Explicit culture (written principles)
- Beat Silicon Valley (execution > funding)

### **What We're Doing:**
- Specializing in regulated agriculture (export crops, EU compliance)
- Building deep expertise (pesticide limits, organic certification)
- Charging for outcomes (crops saved, not diagnoses)
- High-agency AI (reserves treatment, schedules applications)
- Explicit culture (10 operating principles)
- Beating competitors (specialization > generalization)

**Same playbook. Same philosophy. Same results.**
